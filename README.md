# Vip_plugin
A plugin written in pawn for amxmodx for Deathrun GameMode. 

You can add VIPs and they'll benefit from different aspects. 

They've got 150hp and 100 armour, can select custom skins for knives or player model, also have custom skins for all weapons. 

They can select a sound to be played at the end of the round, when they kill the terrorist.
